[Codeforces](www.codeforces.com) gives you the ability to change your rank in the first couple of days of every year.

With this extension you can make your own happiness and change your rank at any time, to any rank you want, even to **Headquarters!!!**

It's not how others see you, it's how you see yourself as a king while looking at the mirror :D
